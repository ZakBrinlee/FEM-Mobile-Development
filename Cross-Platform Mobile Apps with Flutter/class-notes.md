## Notes
- I first started using Flutter in 2019. Spent 40+ hours writing Flutter/Dart code before taking a break

## Links
- [Material Icons included with Flutter](https://fonts.google.com/icons) -
- [menu Json](https://firtman.github.io/coffeemasters/api/menu.json) 
- [JSON to Dart tool](https://javiercbk.github.io/json_to_dart/)
- [Learn PWA - Web Book written by Max](https://web.dev/learn/pwa/)


## Top Level Notes
- Using inspector does not work as web. Flutter uses a 2D canvas
- Built in Icon library from material Icons
  - https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/Icons-class.html
- Input properties for widgets, must be `final`
- Dart doesn't map automatically JSON values into classes
- Dart supports async promises as `Futures`
